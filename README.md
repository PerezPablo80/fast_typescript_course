Tests and project on a typescript course to re engage typescript

For the nodeJs project with express that should have typescript, simple create the folder `mkdir chatapp`, inside (`cd chatapp`) write: `npx tsc --init`
Then add: `npm install express socket.io`

To run it `npx ts-node app.ts` that generate the app.js and then `node app.js` 
In the example is not done with Typescript, just with JS so for this is just a JS app.
In the excercises that were shown, on the root folder was place the `npx tsc --init` and then create the type.ts file, for that to execute the file: `tsc type.ts` generate the type.js and with it, use `node type.js` to execute the js app

In the express-typescript example yes, you access the folder, then `npm install` and to execute it: `npm run start` that convert to js and then node <file.js> the program.

## The course:[simplilearn free course Typescript the new Javascript for web dev](https://lms.simplilearn.com/courses/5896/Typescript-:-The-New-JavaScript-for-Web-Development/syllabus)
The course is simple but got almost everything to start.

Here i place some ideas of the course and the chatapp that is basic but shows how to work with socket.io
The problem is that it lacks of TS on it. But other than that is a good use of socket.io hehehe.
